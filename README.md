# CNN_VGG_BrainTumorClassification
This a deep learning project I have been working on regarding Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Classification for Brain Tumor MRI. The architecture I'm implementing is a modified VGG Conv Net. This particular deep learning pipeline is an example of transfer learning from a cat classification tensorflow exercise.
