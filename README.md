# CNN_VGG_BrainTumorClassification
This a deep learning project I have been working on post Andrew Ng's specialization. This project involves Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Classification for Brain Tumor MRI Data. The architecture I'm implementing is a modified VGG Conv Net in TensorFlow. The source code is called CNN_PET.py (I initially intended to use PET (positron emission tomography) images). Training data is included. Dropout regularization was implemented to reduce overfitting of the model. Algorithm runs with classification accuracy 98%, validation accuracy 96%. In future, would be good to collate multiple different sources of data, so that algorithm is fully generalizable to arbitrary MRI data.
